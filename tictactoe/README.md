# Tic Tac Toe Kata

##### Nice explanation 

The rules of the tic tac toe game are the following:

- A game is over when: 
    * All fields are taken

    * all fields in a column are taken by a player
    
    * all fields in a row are taken by a player
    
    * all fields in a diagonal are taken by a player

- A player can take a field if not already taken
- Players take turns taking fields until the game is over
- There are two player in the game (X and O)

##### Messy explanation

X always goes first.

Players cannot play on a played position

Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
All nine squares are filled.

If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
